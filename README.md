# Git Groomer

Take care of your git repo!

## Warning

I'm starting this from the ground up and I have yet to decide how the API layout will be.
Documentation and tests will roll out in a couple of days.

I see no point on using this until a proper structure and quality is assured.
Until then, you can run the tests and take a look at the code!

## Setup and run test
(Cause at the moment that's the only thing you can safely do)

### Setup
`pipenv install --dev`

### Run tests
`pipenv run py.test tests`
